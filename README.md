### Abstract

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, making it difficult for investors and learners to assess risk accurately. This project, **Crypto Volatility and Risk Analyzer**, analyzes historical cryptocurrency price data to measure volatility and evaluate risk using statistical and data analytics techniques. By visualizing volatility trends and risk indicators, the system helps users better understand market instability and supports informed decision-making.
